After struggling with infertility for several months, I received a surgery to aid in our ttc journey. Immediately after, we conceived our first child in June of 2021. The pregnancy was challenging, as I dealt with extreme morning sickness and then experienced my first large bleed at 10 weeks and 6 days gestation. We were diagnosed with a subchorionic hematoma at this point, and I continued to bleed the remainder of the pregnancy. At 16 weeks and 5 days we had our first appointment with a maternal fetal medicine specialist, and at this point were told that we had a less than 50% chance of reaching viability due to the constant bleeding and the large size of the hematoma. We went home, and I went into labor Friday night (although we did not know at the time that it was labor). We ended up going to the ER due to the amount of pain that I was in early Sunday morning, and I gave birth to our sweet baby girl, Nora Marjorie Lyons, at 3:40am on October 3rd, 2021 at 17 weeks and 2 days gestation. She was measuring a few weeks ahead, and was so perfectly formed. We experienced a significant amount of medical trauma due to the events that unfolded, and were thrown into grief.\", -1))\nconst _hoisted_4 = /*#__PURE__*/ _withScopeId(() => /*#__PURE__*/_createElementVNode(\"p\", null, \"We began ttc again in January 2022, anticipating the journey to take a while, but were blessed with an immediate positive pregnancy test that month.
